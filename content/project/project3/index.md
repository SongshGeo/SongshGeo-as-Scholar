## Introduction

Grassland offers a significant share of ecological services, but its degradation under anthropogenic interventions is increasing worldwide. The grassland of Inner Mongolia is among the most degraded regions because of overgrazing, where effective ecological restoration practices should be applied. However, decades of restricted government-leading restoration projects seem ineffective. At the same time, the self-organization practices of herders have led to win-win outcomes in ecology and the economy. Therefore, we argued that the social-ecological systems (SES) framework should be applied in the ecological restoration of the grassland area. Here, we take Urad Middle Banner as a typical example, where self-organized governance is spreading and encouraged, studying how self-organization can help to restore grasslands.

## Background

## Goals & Scientific questions

My research attempts to dive into the "tragedy of common" grassland problem. 

<!-- 为什么当地牧民上千年的智慧能够帮助广阔的草原不退化，而草原私有化、建立围栏后却迅速退化？为什么这一切发生在现代“文明”侵入草原之后？为什么围栏、私有化这些“现代的”管理手段没能帮助草原走出退化的困局？草原管理究竟是公地悲剧还是“私地悲剧”？ -->

- Why did the wisdom of local herders for thousands of years help to keep the vast grasslands from degrading, while they rapidly degraded after privatisation and the creation of fences? 
- Why did all this happen after modern 'civilisation' had invaded the grasslands? Why did fencing and privatisation, the "modern" management tools, fail to help the grasslands out of their degradation predicament? 
- I mean, the most important theoretical question is: **Is grassland management a tragedy of the commons or a "tragedy of the private sector"?**
