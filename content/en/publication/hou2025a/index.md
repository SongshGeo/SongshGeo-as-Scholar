abstract: 'Study area: The Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China is a critical grain-producing
  region that experiences severe water scarcity and intense competition for water
  resources. Study focus: Agricultural irrigation is the primary water use in the
  YRB. However, the spatiotemporal patterns and alignment between irrigation water
  requirement (IWR) and supply remain unclear. This study quantified the spatiotemporal
  variations in IWR in the YRB, focusing on the alignment within the irrigation system.
  A process-based crop water model was used to calculate IWR for five major crops
  from 2001 to 2100, with future projections under three Shared Socio-economic Pathways.
  The spatiotemporal patterns of total IWR and whether they align with actual irrigation
  water use and supply were analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region: IWR
  in the highest irrigation areas exceeded 500 mm/yr. Two annual peaks were identified:
  March to May and July to August. Spatial and seasonal mismatches in the irrigation
  system were evident. Spatially, irrigation water use exceeded requirements in the
  source regions and upper reaches but failed to meet requirements in the middle and
  lower reaches. Seasonally, irrigation water supply peaked earlier than crop water
  requirements. Future projections suggest that seasonal mismatches will persist and
  may intensify due to delayed requirement peaks and increasing requirements. These
  findings highlight the importance of institutional adaptation in enhancing water
  resilience and sustainability in the Anthropocene.'
summary: This study quantifies the spatiotemporal variations in irrigation water requirements
  (IWR) for major crops in the Yellow River Basin, revealing significant mismatches
  between IWR and actual water supply, particularly in the middle and lower reaches,
  with future projections indicating that these discrepancies may worsen. The findings
  underscore the need for institutional adaptations to improve water resilience and
  sustainability in the region.
