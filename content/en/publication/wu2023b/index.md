abstract: At the mid-point to 2030, progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development
  Goals (SDGs) varies significantly across countries. While the classification of
  countries can lay the foundation for improving policy efficiency and promoting joint
  action, bottom-up, SDG data-driven country classifications have largely remained
  unexplored. Here, we classified 166 countries based on their performances in the
  17 SDGs and further used the classification to analyze SDG interactions and compare
  development aid distributions. The countries were classified into five groups, ranging
  from “lowest development with good environment” to “high development needing climate
  action”. None of them scored highly in all SDGs, and due to trade-offs related to
  environment and climate SDGs, none of them can achieve all SDGs eventually. To maximize
  the potential for achieving the SDGs, all countries need to undergo a sustainable
  transformation, and prioritizing certain SDGs, such as SDG 9 (industry, innovation
  and infrastructure), can help countries with lower sustainable development levels
  achieve more with less. Furthermore, global development aid should be better aligned
  with country needs, particularly in areas of education, energy, environment, and
  water supply and sanitation. By better characterizing different countries, this
  study reveals the bleak prospects of achieving all SDGs and provides valuable insights
  into more targeted actions for national sustainable development and global collaboration.
summary: This study classifies 166 countries based on their performance in the Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) into five groups, revealing that no country excels in all
  SDGs and highlighting the need for targeted actions and better-aligned development
  aid to facilitate sustainable transformations. The findings emphasize that prioritizing
  certain SDGs, like industry and innovation, can help lower-performing countries
  achieve more sustainable development.
