abstract: Floodplains are crucial agricultural and populated areas worldwide. Rivers
  typically shape human activities within floodplains through water supply and flood
  risk, forming unique human-nature interaction patterns. Given that river systems
  have undergone significant transformations globally, understanding the response
  of these interactions to hydrological changes is elementary. Here, using the Lower
  Yellow River Floodplain (LYRF) as a case, where continuous levees distinctly outline
  the river-influenced floodplain from a homogenous cultivated plain and the riverâ€™s
  hydrology has undergone dramatic alterations since the 1990s, we analyzed how the
  human-nature interactions respond to river hydrological changes. This study found
  that the flood-prone nature of the Lower Yellow River has weakened from 1986 to
  2021 as shown by decreased surface water extent and inundated extent of cropland.
  The intensity of agriculture inside the LYRF has been lower but experienced faster
  development than outside, minimizing the disparity between them. Meanwhile, human
  activities in the floodplain have moved closer to the river. These changes in human-nature
  interactions in the LYRF can be explained by the river stabilization caused by upstream
  regulation, underscoring the significance of integrated river governance in managing
  human-nature system in floodplain areas.
summary: This study of the Lower Yellow River Floodplain reveals that hydrological
  changes since the 1990s have weakened the flood-prone nature of the area, leading
  to reduced surface water and inundation of cropland, while agricultural intensity
  has increased more rapidly within the floodplain compared to surrounding areas.
  The findings highlight the impact of river stabilization from upstream regulation
  on human-nature interactions, emphasizing the need for integrated river governance
  in floodplain management.
