abstract: Hydropower, an important renewable energy source worldwide, is threatened
  by reservoir sedimentation. Ecological restoration (ER) can mitigate this by reducing
  upstream sediment, thereby extending hydropower facilities’ lifespan. However, ER
  may also reduce runoff, potentially diminishing energy generation and complicating
  its overall impact on hydropower potential. Here, we examine China’s Yellow River,
  once the world’s most sediment-laden river, using eco-hydrological and reservoir
  regulation models to assess how large-scale ER influences the hydropower potential
  of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, which controls 92.3% of the basin area. Our results
  indicate that, excluding upstream reservoirs’ operations and socioeconomic water
  use, Xiaolangdi could generate a total of ~2.7×10^11 kWh of energy before facing
  diminished flexibility and efficiency caused by the exhaustion of sediment storage—57.3%
  more than without ER—equating to an additional ~100 billion kWh. This enhancement
  in hydropower potential primarily arises from the extended lifespan, despite a 6.9%
  reduction in average annual energy generation. These findings advance our understanding
  of the ecosystem-water-sediment-energy nexus, offering valuable insights for integrated
  watershed management globally.
summary: This study evaluates the impact of ecological restoration (ER) on the hydropower
  potential of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir on China's Yellow River, finding that while
  ER can enhance energy generation capacity by 57.3% due to extended sediment storage
  lifespan, it may also lead to a 6.9% reduction in average annual energy output.
  The findings highlight the complex interplay between ecosystem management and hydropower
  efficiency, providing insights for integrated watershed management.
