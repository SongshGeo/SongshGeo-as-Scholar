abstract: ABSESpy is a novel agent-based modeling (ABM) framework that facilitates
  socio-ecological systems (SES) research. It serves as an extension package of Mesa,
  the most popular ABM framework, and further enhances agents’ interactions with other
  components, especially grid-like spaces. With a configuration file for managing
  parameters and an improved data Input/Output system, ABSESpy’s modularity and low-coupling
  design enable elegant maintenance of large modeling projects. In addition, ABSESpy
  includes a schedule that aligns models’ tick with the calendar time. These innovations
  position ABSESpy as a valuable tool in fostering more ABMs for real-world SES issues.
  Its ultimate aim is to become the go-to choice for ABM when working with a human-involved
  changing world.
summary: ABSESpy is an innovative agent-based modeling framework designed to improve
  the fidelity of socio-ecological systems research by integrating complex decision-making,
  scaling, and data integration through its Branch-Leaf architecture. Its capabilities
  in modeling human behavior and accommodating diverse temporal scales make it a vital
  tool for addressing existing gaps in SES research and enhancing the applicability
  of ABMs to real-world issues.
