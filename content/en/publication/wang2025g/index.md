abstract: The Yellow River Basin supports a population of 200 million people and contains
  15% of arable land in China. Water scarcity in the region is being exacerbated by
  climate change and human activities. In this Review, we discuss anthropogenic impacts
  on the hydrological cycle and sediment dynamics of the Yellow River since the 1950s.
  The Yellow River had one of the largest sediment loads in the world, peaking at
  2.1 Gt yr−1 in 1958. Such high sediment loads elevated flood risk; therefore, reservoirs,
  conservation and revegetation projects were implemented, reducing sediment transport
  by 90% since the 1980s. However, these efforts also impacted the hydrology of the
  Yellow River Basin, leading to an increase in evapotranspiration fluxes (1.79 mm
  yr−2, 1980–2020) and reduced runoff. In addition, human water use has increased
  by 15.8% since the 1980s. The resulting reductions in soil water storage and intensification
  of the vertical water cycle foreshadow potential resource crises and will potentially
  lead to irreversible ecosystem degradation. Predicting the outcomes of water management
  policies and engineering projects is essential but highly complex owing to feedback
  loops and interactions between human activities and hydrological changes. Addressing
  these challenges, which are also faced by other arid-region rivers, will require
  dynamic monitoring of water storage and improved understanding of human–hydrological
  interactions.
summary: This review highlights the significant anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological
  cycle and sediment dynamics of the Yellow River Basin since the 1950s, noting a
  90% reduction in sediment transport due to conservation efforts, which has led to
  increased evapotranspiration and reduced runoff. The findings emphasize the need
  for dynamic monitoring and a better understanding of human-hydrological interactions
  to address potential resource crises and ecosystem degradation in the region.
