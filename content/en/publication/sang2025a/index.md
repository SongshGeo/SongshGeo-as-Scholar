abstract: A mechanistic understanding and modeling of the coupled human and natural
  systems (CHANS) are frontier of geographical sciences and essential for promoting
  regional sustainability. Modeling regional CHANS in the Yellow River Basin (YRB)
  featuring high water stress, intense human interference, and a fragile ecosystem
  has always been a complex challenge. Here, we propose a conceptual modeling framework
  to capture key human-natural components and their interactions, focusing on human-water
  dynamics. The modeling framework encompasses five human (Population, Economy, Energy,
  Food, and Water Demand) and five natural sectors (Water Supply, Sediment, Land,
  Carbon, and Climate) that can be either fully interactive or standalone. The modeling
  framework, implemented using the system dynamics (SD) approach, can well reproduce
  the basinâ€™s historical evolution in human-natural processes and predict future dynamics
  under various scenarios. The flexibility, adaptability, and potential for integration
  with diverse methods position the framework as an instructive tool for guiding regional
  CHANS modeling. Our insights highlight pathways to advance regional CHANS modeling
  and its application to address regional sustainability challenges.
summary: This study presents a conceptual modeling framework for coupled human and
  natural systems (CHANS) in the Yellow River Basin, focusing on human-water dynamics
  through a system dynamics approach. The framework effectively captures interactions
  between key human and natural components, successfully reproducing historical trends
  and predicting future scenarios, thereby offering valuable insights for enhancing
  regional sustainability efforts.
