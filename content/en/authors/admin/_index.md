👋 Hello! I'm Shuang Song, currently delving into [postdoctoral research at Beijing Normal University](https://zkgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/lyhjstgcyfzx/rcdw4/c468f5e085f1420c871fa312ff7ce385.htm).
My research ambit primarily revolves around deciphering the intricate dynamics between human and environmental systems, with a keen focus on the evolving interplay of human-water relationships.
At the heart of my current investigations is the utilization of the social-ecological system (SES) framework, complemented by advanced methodologies in complex system modeling, particularly agent-based modeling.
Beyond research, I'm an adept Python developer and have crafted [the open-source package `ABSESpy`](https://github.com/ABSESpy/ABSESpy), a tool designed to enhance the simulation capabilities for real-world SES scenarios.
