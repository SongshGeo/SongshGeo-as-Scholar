👋 Hello! I'm Shuang Song, a postdoctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology](https://www.gea.mpg.de). I currently serve for two departments: [the Department Structural Changes of the Technosphere](https://www.gea.mpg.de/7775/dt) and the [Department of Co-evolution of Land Use and Urbanisation](https://www.gea.mpg.de/114175/dlu).

My research primarily uses water as a link to study the co-evolution between human society and the natural environment. Based on my interdisciplinary background in Physical Geography and the Study of History, I currently focus on the long-term evolution of water management (e.g., irrigation, flood control, and water supply) and its impact on human society, currently focusing on the Yellow River Basin, China.

My approach mainly involves modeling and data analysis. I developed the open-source Agent-based Modeling framework for real-world SES simulation [`ABSESpy`](https://github.com/SongshGeoLab/ABSESpy) and led [`PaperBell` team](https://paperbell.cn/), an academic note-taking workflow for researchers based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

My research is highly interdisciplinary; I welcome scholars and students from Geography, Archaeology, History, Sociology, Computer Science, and Psychology to collaborate. The team offers fully remote positions, feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:song@gea.mpg.de) or [online meeting](https://cal.com/s-huang-song-sodoej/get-in-touch).
