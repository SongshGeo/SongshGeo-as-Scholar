👋 Hello! I'm Shuang Song, a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Co-evolution of Land Use and Urbanisation, Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology.

My research primarily uses water as a link to study the interaction and co-evolution between human society and the natural environment. Based on my interdisciplinary background in Physical Geography and the Study of History, I currently focus on the long-term evolution of water management and its impact on human society in major river basins.
I also examine how institutions can influence human-water interaction by changing human society's adaptation and resilience to environmental changes, thereby contributing to sustainable development.

My approach mainly involves modeling, simulation, and data analysis. I developed the open-source Agent-based Modeling framework for real-world SES simulation [`ABSESpy`](https://github.com/SongshGeoLab/ABSESpy) and led [`PaperBell`](https://paperbell.songshgeo.com/), an academic note-taking workflow for researchers based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

My research is highly interdisciplinary; I welcome scholars and students from Geography, Archaeology, History, Sociology, Computer Science, and Psychology to collaborate. Please contact me by email or [online meeting](https://cal.com/s-huang-song-sodoej/get-in-touch).
