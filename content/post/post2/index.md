## Overview

<!-- 水作为人类生存和社会发展的必要资源，既受到人类活动的强烈影响，又深刻塑造着人类社会，也就是说，从皇帝到庶民，从工程师到企业家，终需考虑与水相关的问题。可惜的是，我们或是竭泽而渔，或是失于算计。无论你是否注意到，我们都通过使用、储存、污染......，来和同一个水循环中的其它“主体”相联系。

随着技术的进步与水资源重要性的愈发凸显，我们自认为成为了更“聪明”的决策者、管理者、使用者......，但事实是，水系统的耗竭与崩溃却在世界各地接连发生。所以，也许我们更需要做的，是把社会系统与水文系统联系起来，用考虑了各类“主体”的模型来加深我们对这种联系的认识，从而作为一个更聪明的群体来管理这种公共资源。

流域是一个水文系统的完整单元，让我们从这里开始 ... ... -->
As an essential resource for human survival and social development, water is both strongly influenced by human activity and profoundly shaped human society. It means that everyone, from emperors to commoners, from engineers to entrepreneurs, needs to consider water-related issues. Unfortunately, we withdraw water unsustainably, or fail at water restoration. Whether you notice it or not, we are connected to other 'agents' in the same water cycle by using, storing, polluting, and so on...

As technology advances and the importance of water becomes more apparent, we think we have become wiser decision makers, managers and users of  water, individually. BUT the truth is that water systems are being depleted and collapsing all over the world. So perhaps what we need to do more than anything else is to link social systems to hydrological systems, to deepen our understanding of this linkage using models that take into account the various 'agents' that manage the "common pool" as a wiser "group".

A river basin is a complete unit of a hydrological system, so let's start here ... ...

在河流流域中，水是一种公共资源，它具有水文上的连通性。基于主体的建模则是反应社会系统，尤其是考虑不同利益主体之间交互的研究手段。如果在流域尺度上审视这个由水文系统和社会系统间相互作用构成的社会-水文系统，任由自然水文循环也是不符合利益的，而满足每个利益主体的诉求也几乎是不可能的。

因此，针对这样一个复杂系统，我们最终的目的应该更关注如何在整体可持续发展的目标基础上，寻找提升系统弹性的解决方案与发展情景。为此，我们如何不断解决来自水文系统的挑战是一个关键理论，因为这决定了我们看待社会水文系统的方式，并在把握复杂系统发展趋势的基础上从众多当下的解决方案中找到更有利于未来弹力整体提升的措施。更具体来说，在单独的水利工程措施日益显现其不可持续性的当下，如何将社会系统纳入并发展有效的制度解决方案，很可能是着眼未来的水治理解决方案，因而如何发挥制度的关键作用，就需要我们从流域的众多利益相关者开始谈起。

我的研究就试图从具体到宏观，对上述问题给出初步探索。具体来说，我试图通过基于主体的模型来分析社会水文系统的复杂性，从而解决以下几个科学问题：

1. 制度对于可持续水资源治理能起到怎样的关键作用？
2. 当人们试图解决水资源匮乏的问题时，社会-水文系统是否存在演化规律？
3. 基于社会水文系统的复杂相互作用，怎样利用集体智慧，让我们社会能够持续利用水资源？ -->

In river basins, water is a "common-pool" resource that is hydrologically connected. Agent-based modelling is a research tool that responds to social systems, especially by considering the interactions between different stakeholders. If we look at a socio-hydrological system, which consists of interactions between hydrological and social systems, at the basin scale, it is not in the interest to just maintain the natural hydrological cycle to its own devices, and it is also almost impossible to satisfy the demands of each stakeholders' interest.

(1) Therefore, for such a complex system, our ultimate aim should be to focus more on finding solutions and development scenarios that enhance the resilience of the system based on the goal of overall sustainable development. 
(2) To this end, how we continuously address the challenges from the hydrological system would be a key theorical base, as it determines the way we think of the socio-hydrological system and find the approach that are more conducive to an overall increase in resilience in the future, based on a grasp of the development trends of the complex system from the many current solutions. 
(3) More specifically, at a time when stand-alone water engineering measures are becoming increasingly unsustainable, the integration of social systems and the development of effective institutional solutions are likely to be the resilience-oriented solutions to water governance in the future, and therefore the key role of institutions requires us to start with modelling the stakeholders of the basin.

My research attempts to provide an initial exploration of these issues, from the concrete to the macro. Specifically, I seek to analyse the complexity of socio-hydrological systems through a subject-based model that addresses the following scientific questions of "three -tions":

1. **Institution**: what is the key role that institutions can play in sustainable water governance?
2. **Evolution**: are there evolutionary patterns in socio-hydrological systems when addressing water stress?
3. **Solution**: based on the complex interactions of socio-hydrological systems, how societies to govern common-pool water sustainably?
