Shuang (Twist) Song is a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Faculty of Geographical Science](http://english.geo.bnu.edu.cn/) at Beijing Normal University. His research focuses on understanding the interactions of human and environmental systems, especially evolution in human-water relationships. 
His current research aims to use the framework of the social-ecological system and the methodology of complex system modelling (especially the agent-based model) to explore interplays between human and large river basins, taking the [Yellow River Basin](/project/project5/) in China as an example.
